# Hello-World
My First Github project

Hello world, my name is Coop and I'm happy to be here!
I'm making a career shift and while intimidating, I'm also looking forward to the challenge!
My goal by the end of 2021 is to be proficient enough in data analytics, data management and software coding and development in order to pursue new career opportunities
My hobbies include making and listening to music, watching interesting movies, documentaries, and shows, cooking, releasing endorphins, and spending time with friends and loved ones.

I am looking forward to learning and growing in the data community!
